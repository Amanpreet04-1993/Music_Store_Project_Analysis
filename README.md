This beginner-friendly project will guide you through analyzing a music playlist database. Using SQL, 
you'll explore the dataset and help the store gain insights into its business growth by answering a series of straightforward questions.

I received a database file and a questionnaire from my university for reference. and same has been attached in the profile also as a part of project.

The project is divided into three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
& Each level contains a minimum of 3 to 5 questions.
